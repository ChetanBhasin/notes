Do not frown upon me  
For what I do not have.  
Do not frown upon me  
For I make up for most of that.  

My eyes might not shimmer  
When I see your pocket full of dimes;  
But I promise they'll shine brighter  
When I step outside every time.  

I might not seem so happy  
When you stepped up and I couldn't do.  
I swear it won't be so crappy  
When someday I'll make it too.  

The world seems full of madness  
When your luck climbs and mine crawls.  
There's not need of sadness,  
For I can still stand tall.  

You only see what I'll leave behind.  
You make it look so hard.  
I believe in things of different kinds,  
And I see all the hidden cards.  

Those who fight are better than those who don't.  
You just have to make the call.  
Those who believe are better than those who don't,  
In strength of standing tall.  

Do not frown upon me  
For everything I have lost.  
Do not frown upon me  
For I'll get back at any cost.
